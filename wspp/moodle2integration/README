INSTALLATION :

0) IMPORTANT : First make sure that the Moodle 2.0 official Web Service is up and running 
on your Moodle server and that you succeded in some testing operations.

1) copy the folder 'oktech' into the 'local' directory of your Moodle 2.0 installation

2) as an admin user, visit the link 'Notifications' of 'Site adminstration' . You should
see after few moments 'local_oktech ' Success . This has installed into Moodle 2.0 database
and external service named oktech WS with all available functions installed. These functions
will appear in Web Service's plugin administration screen prefixed with oktech_ such as 

oktech_add_group	
oktech_add_grouping	
oktech_add_label	
oktech_add_noneditingteacher	 add a non editing teacher role to userid identified by useridfield to courseid identified by courseidfield
...

Currently the documentation of Web Services functions is not available for admin users under Profile, Security Keys ; this
is a limitation of Moodle 2.0, not of OK Tech ;-) So you must connect to Moodle as a regular user to consult it.


USAGE :

In addition to its historical way ( i.e : call login, fetch a LoginReturn object and sent it with the target function , then call to logout),
that is of course still supported in SOAP/REST mode,  you may now call all OK Tech operations the Moodle 2.0 way, that is without calling first login. 

For example in REST mode, with simple authentification you can use :

 http://localhost/moodle20/webservice/rest/simpleserver.php?wsusername=xxx&wspassword=xxx&wsfunction=oktech_get_roles
 
 or
 
 http://localhost/moodle20/webservice/rest/simpleserver.php?wsusername=xxxx&wspassword=xxxx&wsfunction=oktech_get_users&userids[0]=ppollet&idfield=username
 
 
 Note that these calls are exactly the same as those of OKTech in REST/singleshot mode, excpect that the function name must be prefixed by oktech_
 
 And in 'token mode '

http://localhost/moodle20/webservice/rest/server.php?wstoken=123456789abcdefgh&wsfunction=oktech_get_groups_byname&groupname=18


Note that currently, if you already logged in to Moodle you MUST call these URLS using ANOTHER Web Browser (or another computer) . 
Otherwise you will receive an error about extraneous parameters found in the http request. This Moodle 2.0 feature has been reported
on Moodle's tracker.

One solution is to use Linux wget command as follow :

wget 'http://localhost/moodle20/webservice/rest/simpleserver.php?wsusername=xxxxx&wspassword=zzzzz&wsfunction=oktech_get_roles' -O getroles
(Don't forget the simple quotes around the URL ! )

Currently the OK Tech specific parameter wsformatout (that can be json, xml, php or dump) is not supported by Moodle 2.0 infrastructure. So 
you will receive the results in official Moodle 2.0 XML and parse them the same way as the current Moodle 2.0 operations.
Adding this parameter on the official Moodle 2.0 infrastructure has also been requested on Moodle's tracker.


Finally, for some reasons, the XML result is passed to PHP htmlentities function, thus replacing all accentuated characters by HTML tags. This
will bother some browsers. This has also been reported on the Moodle Tracker. 

MISSING FEATURES :

the OK Tech functions cannot yet be tested in Site Adminstration/plugins/Web Services / overview



Enjoy
